# Problem_Solving
Practise Problem Solving
For each of the four problem solving problems below, write out the steps it will take to go about solving the problem. For example, once you are done writing out the steps for the “reverse a string” problem, you would then write out the code to solve the problem. You would then repeat the process for each ensuing problem. Ideally, this will be a good habit that you will develop and carry forward with you for all problems you encounter at devCodeCamp and beyond.
